# Uncomment the following line to get the legacy default config back for the settings
#SETTINGS_PATH=${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/workspaces/main/development/settings

# This following disables legacy support for devonfw-ide configuration templates in IDE workspace folders.
# Here, it is disabled since this is the configuration ready for IDEasy that does not need legacy support.
# The new variable syntax in workspace template files is $[<variable-name>]
# If legacy support is enabled, then also ${<variable-name>} is supported additionally.
# However, this often clashes with the variable syntax used by IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
# Therefore it causes some log-spam for variables that could not be resolved and could also lead to problems
# in edge-cases where variables get resolved by IDEasy that should actually remain as is and only be resolved
# by the actual IDE itself.
# Please note that in ide.properties/devon.properties files the syntax is still ${<variable-name>}
